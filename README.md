# 50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS &amp; JS
These are the project files for the Udemy course 50 Projects in 50 Days, taught by Brad Traversy.
This is also an experimentation with using branches as a way to keep projects together but separate. 

The main branch will contain boiler plate, starter code for the projects; each branch will correspond to the project day/number.
